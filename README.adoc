= Docker Linter

🚀 *Docker Linter* is a powerful tool for analyzing and improving your Dockerfiles. It helps detect potential issues, enforces best practices, and optimizes your container images for performance, security, and maintainability.

== Features

- ✅ Detects common Dockerfile mistakes and inefficiencies.
- 🚨 Categorizes issues by severity: *Critical*, *High*, *Medium*, and *Low*.
- 🛠 Provides explanations and recommendations for each issue.
- 🎨 Real-time linting with a visual editor powered by *Monaco Editor*.
- 🔍 Optimizes Dockerfiles for smaller, faster, and more secure container images.

== Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project running on your local machine.

=== Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Docker (optional, for testing linted Dockerfiles)

=== Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/baturyusaoezdemir/docker-linter.git`  
   
   `cd docker-image-linter`

2. Install dependencies:  
   `npm install`

3. Start the development server:  
   `npm run dev`

4. Open the app in your browser:  
   `http://localhost:3000`

== Usage

1. Paste your Dockerfile into the *Monaco Editor* on the app.  
2. Click the `Lint Dockerfile` button.  
3. Review the categorized results below the editor:
   - *Critical*: Must-fix issues that impact security or functionality.
   - *High*: Strong recommendations to improve performance or security.
   - *Medium*: Best practices that improve maintainability.
   - *Low*: Minor improvements or optional fixes.
4. Hover over each issue to see detailed explanations and suggested solutions.

== Rules

Docker Linter uses a set of 40+ rules to analyze your Dockerfile. Here are some examples:

- *Critical*: Avoid running containers as `root`.
- *High*: Clean up `apt-get` cache to reduce image size.
- *Medium*: Combine `RUN` commands to optimize layers.
- *Low*: Add clear and concise comments.
